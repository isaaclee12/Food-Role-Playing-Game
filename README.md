# Food-Role-Playing-Game

A simple mock-up prototype of a role-playing game that uses a type system similar to that of the Pokemon series.

This was created as the final project for our Advanced Programming Course at UVM.

The project utilizes testing functions, pointers, OOP, and more.

This project was created using JetBrains CLion. To run this program you can clone this repo to CLion and run it from there, otherwise you will have to run CMAKE through another means in order to compile and run the binaries.
